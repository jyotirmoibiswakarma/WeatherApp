A Simple Gradient Weather App
The provided HTML and CSS code constitute the foundation of a user-friendly weather application interface. Here's an in-depth summary of its features and design principles:

#HTML:

The HTML structure is meticulously crafted to ensure a well-organized layout for the weather application interface.
It begins with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration followed by the <html> root element with the specified language attribute set to "en".
Within the <head> section, meta tags are included to define character encoding and viewport settings for better responsiveness on various devices.
The title of the application, "Weather App", is set within the <title> tag.
An external stylesheet, "style.css", is linked to enhance the visual presentation and maintain separation of concerns.
The <body> element encapsulates the entire content of the application, facilitating structured display and interaction.


#CSS:

The CSS rules are meticulously crafted to achieve a visually appealing and user-friendly design for the weather application.
A global reset is applied to standardize default margin, padding, font-family, and box-sizing across different browsers for a consistent user experience.
The background of the body is elegantly styled with a dark color scheme (#222), providing a visually appealing backdrop for the application content.
The main container for the weather application, designated with the .card class, undergoes comprehensive styling to ensure an aesthetically pleasing appearance.
The search bar, represented by the .search class, is meticulously designed with carefully chosen padding, border-radius, and alignment properties to enhance usability and visual appeal.
The weather information elements, including temperature, city name, weather icon, humidity, and wind speed, are styled with appropriate font sizes, colors, and alignments to ensure readability and aesthetic harmony.
Special attention is given to error handling, with the error message container styled for clear visibility and readability in case of invalid user input or network errors.
Overall, the combination of well-structured HTML markup and thoughtfully crafted CSS styles results in a visually stunning and highly functional weather application interface. Users are provided with an intuitive platform to effortlessly access and explore weather information for different cities while enjoying a seamless and visually appealing user experience.
